excerpt: 'No person is an island, and neither are criminal groups. Yet, limited attention has been paid by criminologists to the relational patterns established among groups operating within the same locale. In this paper, we study the structure and determinants of cooperative interactions among organized crime groups (OCGs) operating in Merseyside (UK). We leverage a police dataset including 5,239 crime reports handled by Merseyside Police between January 2015 and March 2018 (42 full months of data) concerning 1,211 OCG members belonging to 134 OCGs.
