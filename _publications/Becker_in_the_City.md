title: "Becker in the City: a Theory of Crime Diffusion in Urban Landscapes"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/Becker_in_the_City.pdf
excerpt: 'This paper studies the role of urban networks in the diffusion of crime across neighborhoods from a Beckerian perspective. We offer two contributions. First, we discipline the interaction between local (i.e. within neighborhood) and global (between neighborhoods) features of a city that may lead an idiosyncratic spike in the crime activity within some neighborhood to propagate across the city.  We derive a theorem to show that the role of network is ambiguous: contagion is pinned down to the interconnectivity between two sets of neighborhood, ``vulnerable'' and ``trigger'' neighborhoods, and their socio-demographic properties. Depending on the connectivity between these two sets, urban networks can either amplify or dilute localized shocks. Therefore, we contend that strategies exclusively targeting vulnerable neighborhoods are not necessarily the most effective ones. Second, we use our theory to study crime diffusion in the London Metropolitan Area (UK). To do so, we calibrate our model on a very granular dataset comprising all crime events recorded in the London Metropolitan Area  in years 2019-2022 together with a battery of granular socio-demographic indicators.'
